  <h1 align="center" id="usage">Usage</h1>
  
  After running the application using command "node index" within the terminal it will prompt you to answer questions about the manager of your team. It will then ask if you'd like to add an engineer, an intern, or be done building your team. If you select engineer or intern it will ask you questions appropriate to their job type. Once you get to the end of the questions it will again prompt you to select between adding an additional member or being done building your team. As soon as you select to be done it will take all of the team members that you have added, their information, and put them into a card style layout within a dynamically generated HTML page.
